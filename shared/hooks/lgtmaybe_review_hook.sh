# lgtmaybe review hook (Claude Code Stop / turn-end) — ADVISORY.
#
# Runs the lgtmaybe PR reviewer over the uncommitted changes the agent just made,
# using Bedrock Claude Opus 4.6 with ambient AWS credentials (nothing secret to
# store — auth resolves from ~/.aws / SSO). Findings are printed to stderr (shown
# in the transcript); the stop is NEVER blocked.
#
# Distinct from post_task_hook.sh (the fast deterministic battery): this is a
# slower, networked LLM review, kept as its own hook so it can be toggled
# independently. It fans out Opus calls per category, so it only runs when code
# actually changed (shared code_changed gate) and applies a severity floor.
#
# Knobs (env):
#   LGTMAYBE_HOOK_ENABLED       "false" to disable entirely (default: true)

#                               (default: bedrock/us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-6;
#                                swap us. → eu./apac. for your AWS region)
#   LGTMAYBE_HOOK_MIN_SEVERITY  severity floor (default: medium)

# Prerequisite: `uv tool install 'lgtmaybe[bedrock]'` (or pipx) so the CLI + boto3
