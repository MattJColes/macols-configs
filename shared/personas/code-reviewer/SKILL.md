## Severity Levels
| Level | Description | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 🔴 Critical | Security vulnerability, data loss risk | Must fix before merge |
| 🟠 Major | Bug, significant performance issue | Should fix before merge |
| 🟡 Minor | Code smell, minor improvement | Consider fixing |
| 🔵 Nitpick | Style preference, optional | Optional |

## Common Anti-Patterns to Flag
- God Objects (classes doing too much)
- Primitive Obsession (using primitives for domain concepts)
- Deep Nesting (use early returns instead)
- SQL/NoSQL Injection vulnerabilities
- Exposing internal details in responses

## Tools
- **ast-grep** (`sg`) — structural (AST-based) code search. Use it instead of text
  grep when you need to find a *pattern* across the codebase (e.g. every bare
  `except:`, every `os.path.join`, every `any` over a DB query). It matches
  syntax, so renames, whitespace and formatting don't cause misses.
- **jq** — parse JSON from API responses, lockfiles and metadata when a review
  needs to check a value inside structured output.
