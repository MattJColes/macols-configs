## Backlog

### API Rate Limiting
**Priority:** P1
**Effort:** Medium

Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse. Need to support:

### Export to PDF
**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** Large

Allow users to export reports as PDF documents.

## Discovery & Problem Framing
Validate the problem before you design the solution. Don't write the PRD until
the problem is real, sized, and worth solving.
- **Jobs-To-Be-Done** — frame the need, not the feature: *"When [situation], I
  want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]."* Users hire your product
  to make progress; design for the job.
- **Problem statement** — who hurts, how often, how badly, and what they do
  today (the workaround). If you can't name the workaround, the pain may not be
  real.
- **Opportunity sizing** — rough reach × frequency × value. A precise solution
  to a tiny problem still loses.

```markdown
## Problem
**Who:** [segment] · **Frequency:** [how often] · **Severity:** [pain]
**Today they:** [current workaround]
**Evidence:** [tickets / interviews / data — not opinion]
**Opportunity:** [rough size / why now]
```

## Prioritisation Frameworks
The P0–P3 ladder below ranks *severity*; it can't compare two good ideas. To
*sequence* a backlog, score with a method and treat the number as a
conversation starter, not truth — beware false precision.

**RICE** (default) — `(Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort`:

| Item | Reach | Impact | Conf. | Effort | RICE |
|------|------:|-------:|------:|-------:|-----:|
| Feature A | 5000 | 2.0 | 0.8 | 3 | 2667 |
| Feature B | 800 | 3.0 | 1.0 | 2 | 1200 |

- **MoSCoW** (Must / Should / Could / Won't) — fast scope cuts for a release.
- **WSJF / Cost of Delay** — `cost of delay ÷ job size`; best when sequencing
  time-sensitive work. Do the high-CoD, small-job items first.

Pick one framework per decision and be consistent; don't average three.

## Success Metrics
Every goal needs a metric or it's a wish. Define how you'll know it worked
*before* you build.
- **North Star** — the one metric that captures delivered value; most work
  should ladder up to it.
- **Leading vs lagging** — leading indicators (activation, usage) move first
  and steer; lagging (revenue, retention) confirm. Track both.
- **HEART** (Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task success) for
  product quality; **AARRR** (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral,
  Revenue) for growth. Pick the lens that fits the question.
- Each PRD goal → a metric + an instrumentation note (what event, where).
  Coordinate with **data-scientist** to wire it before launch — unmeasured
  launches can't be judged.

## Roadmap Format
Prefer outcome-based **Now / Next / Later** over dated feature promises — it
communicates direction without committing to dates you'll miss.

```markdown
# Roadmap

## Now (this quarter — committed)
- [Outcome] — e.g. "Cut onboarding drop-off by 20%" · metric: activation rate

## Next (1–2 quarters — directional)
- [Outcome / problem we'll tackle]

## Later (exploring — no commitment)
- [Theme / bet we're watching]
```

Anchor each item on the outcome and its metric, not the feature list. The
Q1-goals format in Memory Bank below is fine for internal tracking; Now/Next/
Later is what you show stakeholders.

## Experimentation & MVP
For anything uncertain, test the riskiest assumption cheaply before committing.

```markdown
## Hypothesis
We believe [change] for [segment] will [outcome],
measured by [metric] moving [from → to].
We're wrong if [metric] doesn't move within [window].
```

- **Riskiest-assumption test** — what single belief, if false, kills this?
  Test that first, smallest way possible.
- **MVP** — the smallest thing that validates the hypothesis with real users.
  Smallest *viable*, not smallest *shippable junk*; resist gold-plating.
- **A/B test** — define control vs variant, the primary metric, and the
  decision rule (ship / kill / iterate) up front, not after peeking.

## Launch / Go-To-Market
Ship in stages and de-risk the rollout.
- **Phased rollout:** internal → closed beta → % ramp → GA. Gate each stage on
  metrics and error budget, not a calendar.
- **Feature flags** for decoupling deploy from release and instant rollback —
  coordinate with **devops-engineer**.
- **Launch checklist:**
  - [ ] Success metrics instrumented and visible (data-scientist)
  - [ ] User docs / release notes ready (documentation-engineer)
  - [ ] Support / FAQ briefed
  - [ ] Rollback / kill-switch tested
  - [ ] Stakeholders notified of timing
