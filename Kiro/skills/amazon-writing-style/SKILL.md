# Amazon Writing Style

Use this skill when drafting or reviewing narratives, documents, memos, or any formal written content at Amazon. Blends Amazon writing culture with a direct, opinionated, Australian-inflected voice.

## Voice Principles

Write like you're explaining your reasoning to a smart colleague over coffee - direct, warm, opinionated, no corporate fluff.

**Your voice carries these elements into formal docs:**
- **Show your working** - present the problem, walk through options, state your lean with reasoning
- **Be opinionated** - don't just present options, say what you'd do and why. "I reckon we go with option B because..."
- **Active voice always** - "we decided" not "it was decided" (zombie trick: if "by zombies" works after the verb, rewrite)
- **Simple words** - "use" not "leverage", "environment" not "ecosystem", "help" not "facilitate"
- **Direct tone** - "This is the right approach" not "I believe this might be the correct approach"
- **Friendly warmth** - professional but not corporate. You can be direct without being cold
- **No hedging** - cut "I think", "perhaps", "it seems like". State it or qualify with data

**Punctuation rules:**
- No em-dashes. Use " - " (space-dash-space), comma, period, or parentheses instead
- No colons in narrative text. Rewrite to integrate or split into separate sentences
- No semicolons. Two sentences are always better

## Critical Rules

**Rule 1: Narrative Form** - Amazon narratives MUST be written in full sentences and paragraphs, NOT bullet points or tables. Bullets/tables ONLY in appendices. "Full sentences are harder to write. They have verbs. The paragraphs have topic sentences." - Jeff Bezos

**Rule 2: Data over weasel words** - Replace "significant growth" with "23% growth from $100M to $123M". Every claim needs a number or a source.

**Rule 3: Customer-centric** - Address the reader as "you". Refer to the team/company as "we". "You can use this to..." not "This service allows users to..."

**Rule 4: Preserve author intent** - When reviewing, clarify and strengthen. Don't rewrite core arguments. If meaning is unclear, ask.

**Rule 5: Recommendations, not just problems** - Always state what you'd do. Present your reasoning. Address alternatives. Show how you arrived at it.

## Document Structure

### Opening
- State purpose in the first paragraph. Don't make the reader guess why they're reading this
- Start with the vision or the problem - not background
- Make the opening sentence count

### Body
- One topic per paragraph with a clear topic sentence
- Each section builds on the previous (no abrupt jumps)
- Goal-first ordering: "To enable X, do Y" not "If you do Y, then X will happen"
- Present supporting AND contrary data. Point out holes in your own argument

### Closing
- Recommendations with clear reasoning
- Next steps with owners and timelines
- Don't repeat the opening - add something new (the "so what?")

### Reasoning Structure (from your email style)
When presenting decisions or recommendations:
1. State the context in one sentence
2. Walk through options with tradeoffs
3. State your lean and why
4. Acknowledge what you're trading off
5. Invite discussion

Example:
```
We need to decide on the data pipeline architecture for phase 2. There are three realistic options.

Option A keeps the current polling model. It works today for 12 customers but won't scale past 50 without significant rework. We'd be kicking the can down the road.

Option B moves to event-driven with EventBridge. Higher upfront investment (roughly 3 sprints) but gives us the foundation for 500+ customers without rearchitecting again.

Option C is a hybrid - keep polling for existing customers, event-driven for new. Sounds reasonable but means maintaining two codepaths indefinitely. I reckon the operational cost outweighs the short-term savings.

I'd go with Option B. The 3-sprint investment pays for itself by Q3 when we're targeting 80 customers, and we avoid the tech debt of Option C. The main risk is timeline pressure on the Phase 1 launch, but we can mitigate by running the EventBridge work in parallel with customer onboarding.
```

## Writing Mechanics

### Words to kill
| Don't write | Write instead |
|---|---|
| leverage | use |
| ecosystem | environment, platform |
| facilitate | help, enable |
| utilize | use |
| paradigm | model, approach |
| synergy | (delete the sentence) |
| significantly | (use a number) |
| should | must (if required), we recommend (if optional) |
| might, may | can (for capability), we expect (for prediction) |
| in order to | to |
| due to the fact that | because |
| at this point in time | now |
| going forward | (delete - everything is going forward) |

### Modal verbs
| Use | For |
|-----|-----|
| must | requirements and obligations |
| can | capability |
| need to | specific needs |
| we recommend / consider | optional suggestions |
| imperative verb | direct instructions |

### Sentence length
Keep sentences under 25 words. If you're over, split it. Two clear sentences beat one complex one.

### Data-driven claims
- "Sales grew 23% from $100M to $123M in Q4" not "Sales improved significantly"
- "Response time dropped from 450ms to 120ms (p99)" not "We made it faster"
- Always include the baseline, the change, and the timeframe

## Review Workflow

When reviewing a document, work section-by-section:

**For each section, check:**
1. **Weasel words** - flag vague terms, replace with data or remove
2. **Passive voice** - zombie trick test on every sentence
3. **Structure** - topic sentence per paragraph, one topic per paragraph, logical flow
4. **Recommendations** - are they present? Do they state what to do and why?
5. **Service names** - first mention uses full name with short form: "Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)"
6. **Links** - blogs link inline to service pages; narratives use footnotes

**Present findings as:**
```
## Section: [Name]
**Issues:** [X weasel words, Y passive voice, Z long sentences]
**Recommendations:** [numbered list with before/after and rationale]
```

Then ask: apply changes, skip, or discuss specific items.

## Document Types (Quick Reference)

### Narrative (Six-Pager / One-Pager / Two-Pager)
Written document for decision-making. 40% planning, 20% drafting, 40% editing. Six-pagers have strict 6-page max (appendices unlimited). Purpose in first paragraph. Recommendation early. Next steps at end.

### PRFAQ
6-page Working Backwards document. Press Release (1 page max) + FAQ. Answer first: Who is the customer? What's the problem? What's the key benefit? How do you know? What's the experience?

### COE/RCA
Systematic process improvement using 5 Whys. NOT punitive - focuses on mechanisms, not blame. "We" not "they". Facts not feelings.

### Tenets
Principles for team alignment. Numbered, 7 or fewer, opinionated (not "Who Doesn't Do That?"), memorable, positive language. Must be tie-breakers for real decisions.

### Blog Posts
Conversational, educational. Title max 75 chars, intro under 200 words, 1,500 words max total. No FUD language in security blogs.

## Collaborative Writing

- Involve stakeholders early
- "Don't Bake Me a Cake" - show tradeoffs and tensions, not just the final proposal
- Narratives read silently at meeting start (study hall)
- Review in stages: content correctness → flow and clarity → grammar → read aloud
- Write for ESL readers. Complete sentences. Define terms. Avoid idioms

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

- Use "Dear" or "Hello" (use "Hey [Name]," for emails, nothing for docs)
- Write "I hope this email finds you well"
- Use formal transitions ("Furthermore", "Additionally", "In conclusion")
- Hedge with "I believe", "It seems like", "It could be argued that"
- Use passive voice ("it was decided", "mistakes were made")
- Include corporate buzzwords without substance
- Write bullet points in narrative body (appendices only)
- Use em-dashes, colons in narrative, or semicolons
- Present problems without recommendations
- Hide behind committee language ("the team feels") - own your position
